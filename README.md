# dnd-roller
## Introduction
Add in attribute scores and check off which skills are proficient and the program will automatically calculate all modifiers. Rolling for strength checks, saving throws, or any skill is as simple as pushing the correct button.

Additionally, data can be added to the "Attacks & Spellcasting" section for attack and damage rolls. These are written similarly to the way they are on a standard character sheet (name, attack bonus, damage, and type). The attack bonus and damage can be written as any combination of dice rolls, numbers, and modifier shorthands.

Below the output log there is a space for manually inputting any dice rolls and modifiers (in the same format as the attack bonus and damage rolls) which are not already covered.

Finally, when you are done with any setup of your character you can save and name the data to be loaded in another time.

## Modifier Shorthand

prof = Proficiency

str = Strength

dex = Dexterity

con = Constitution

int = Intelligence

wis = Wisdom

The inspiration for this comes directly from the character sheet interface from the roll20 website.
